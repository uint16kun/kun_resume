However, traditional potted plants are mainly cultivated manually, relying more on workers' experience, which is not only unscientific but also time-consuming and labor-intensive, and not suitable for large-scale economic production. To address this issue, this project has designed and implemented a High-Throughput Phenotyping Monitoring System for potted plants, which can achieve real-time monitoring of the growth status, soil nutrient conditions, plant height, and other key parameters of potted plants, and based on this, dynamically regulate water and fertilizer. The system mainly includes three parts: the sensing module, the control module, and the human-machine interaction module. Among them, the sensing module utilizes soil sensors, spectral sensors, laser sensors, and supporting self-developed peripheral functional circuits and mechanical structures to achieve real-time acquisition of high-throughput phenotypic parameters of potted plants. The control module uses the Renesas RA6M5 microcontroller as the control core, mainly responsible for receiving, processing, transmitting, displaying plant phenotypic data, and intelligent decision-making and control of water and fertilizer application. The human-machine interaction module includes a serial screen and a host computer interaction interface, where the serial screen interacts directly with the RA6M5 microcontroller through serial communication, capable of implementing test control and basic test result display functions. The host computer interaction interface runs through a cloud-deployed Vue progressive JavaScript framework, capable of displaying complex data results such as real-time three-dimensional structural modeling of plants. The preliminary development and application of this system can provide scientific and comprehensive guidance for the production of potted plants, better realizing the rapid development of digital agriculture.</p>\"}")
