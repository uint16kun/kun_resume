The cars must have line-following functionality with adjustable speeds between 0.3 ~ 1m/s and be able to complete driving operations on a specified path. The path of the driving area is shown in Figure 1. Point A on the path is the starting and ending point for each trip of the leading car. When the cars complete a trip and reach the end, both the leading and following cars must emit an audible alert. The leading and following cars can either travel along the rounded rectangular path ABFDE (referred to as the inner loop) or the rounded rectangular path ABCDE (referred to as the outer loop). When traveling on the inner loop BFD segment, the cars must emit a light indication. Additionally, during testing, a \\\"stop and wait\\\" indicator can be placed at a designated location on the straight section where point E is located (see the left side of Figure 1), instructing the leading car to stop at this point, wait for 5 seconds, and then continue driving.</p>\"}")
